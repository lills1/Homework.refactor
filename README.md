# Homework.refactor

Description

For this project, I was required to improve the accessibility and functionality of already existing code for a website. This was achieved by using semantic elements, ensuring the structure was logical, and debugging code. I assisted in building this website in order to solidify my understanding of HTML and CSS, particulary in terms of recognising the importance of accessibility and debugging techniques.
